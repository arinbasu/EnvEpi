How to use Madoko
------------------

1. Start with meta data
2. The meta data must be at the head of the document
3. key: value
4. The value can be indented, etc
5. change the cog button at the right hand corner and allow for delayed view

The first thing you want to do is to install madoko local, do:

```
npm install -g madoko-local

```
Once you do this, you can use a command line tool to use madoko. You can use madoko to write locally in a browser (such as Firefox or Chrome) but also store it in Github or store it in dropbox etc. 

We will explore how we can use tables, citations, reference formatting, formulae etc.
